Warning: execve(): Child context executed natively.

        A system call 'execve' is trying to run a command prefixed with '/bin/sh
        -c'. This is usually the result of the execution of the 'system()'
        function from the guest application to run a shell command. Multi2Sim
        will execute this command natively, and will then terminate the calling
        context.
